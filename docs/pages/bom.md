# Sourcing Guide

[Here](/bom/mercury/one) you'll find a listing of all the parts & compontents you need to build your own ZeroG printer.


## Tested by humans
About 90% of the parts listed on the Bill of Materials have been tested by the developers. If you find something isn't working, please do tell us. We'd like to add that we're not responsible if parts do not fit.

## Printing parts

### What material should I use?
ZeroG printers are designed to be printed using ABS(+), ASA or [TitanX](https://www.formfutura.com/shop/product/titanx-2846){:target="_blank"}. This means we've included tollerances for material shrinkage in our models.
It's recommended to print your ABS(+), ASA or [TitanX](https://www.formfutura.com/shop/product/titanx-2846){:target="_blank"} parts inside of an enclosure, this will greatly increase layer strenght.

#### The difference between ABS, ABS+, ASA and TitanX
A quote from [https://all3dp.com/](https://all3dp.com/2/abs-plus-filament-what-is-it/){:target="_blank"} 
> "ABS+, or ABS Plus, aims to reduce the sensitivity to shrinkage and warping of ABS, while preserving most of its performance advantages."

#### How to print ABS
An awesome user from the [Voron](https://vorondesign.com){:target="_blank"} community (and YouTube) that goes by the name of [NERO 3D](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmV40QWkVeRs_nAvEOE_P-g){:target="_blank"} has created a Tips and Tricks playlist on how to print abs. I strongly advise you to checkout his video series before you attempt to print ABS(+).
