# Projects
Hello,

We wanted to let you know that we will be delaying the completion of the projects page on the documentation. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as we work to ensure that the page is accurate and comprehensive. In the meantime, you can find more information about our projects on the [manual](/manual/build) page or by joining our [<i class="bi bi-discord"></i> Discord](https://discord.io/zerog) server.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
