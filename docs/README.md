# Welcome to our GitHub page!

While we're happy to have you here, we want to let you know that you won't find our full range of ZeroG project content here. Instead, we invite you to check out our official website at [https://docs.zerog.one/](https://docs.zerog.one/), where you can explore everything related to our 3D printing projects and other ZeroG initiatives. There, you'll find a wealth of information and resources related to our work, from our latest 3D models to our ambitious plans for space exploration. So don't miss out - head on over to our website and join us on our mission!

# Discord

If you haven't already joined our Discord at [https://discord.gg/zerog](https://discord.gg/zerog), you're missing out on some serious fun! Our Discord server is the perfect place to connect with other makers, share your latest 3D printing projects, and swap some space-themed puns.
